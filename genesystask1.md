⦁	ADA: Ada improves code safety and maintainability by using the compiler to find errors in favor of runtime errors. Ada is an international technical standard, jointly defined by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO), and the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC).
⦁	TYPESCRIPT: TypeScript may be used to develop JavaScript applications for both client-side and server-side execution (as with Node. js or Deno). Multiple options are available for transpilation. The default TypeScript Compiler can be used, or the Babel compiler can be invoked to convert TypeScript to JavaScript.
⦁	PASCAL: Pascal allows the programmers to define complex structured data types and build dynamic and recursive data structures, such as lists, trees and graphs. Pascal offers features like records, enumerations, subranges, dynamically allocated variables with associated pointers and sets.
⦁	LISP: Lisp, an acronym for list processing, is a functional programming language that was designed for easy manipulation of data strings. As one of the oldest programming languages still in use, Lisp offers several different dialects and has influenced the development of other languages.
